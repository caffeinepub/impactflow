  "summary": "The diff implements a comprehensive single-page marketing website for ImpactFlow covering nearly all specified requirements. All major sections are present (Navbar, Hero, About, Water Solution, Industries, How It Works, Social Impact, Why Choose Us, Contact, Footer) with proper design system, Formspree integration, scroll animations, and responsive layouts. A few minor acceptance criteria gaps are noted, and some boilerplate ICP/Internet Identity scaffolding is present that was not requested.",

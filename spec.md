- How It Works section with five numbered steps, connecting visual, and scroll-triggered entrance animations
- Social Impact section with body copy and community illustration image, side-by-side layout on desktop
- Why Choose Us section with five icon + text value proposition cards
- Contact section with five-field form (Name, Organization, Phone, Email, Campaign Objective) integrated with Formspree, success message on submission
- Minimal footer with nav links, social media icon placeholders, and tagline
- Consistent design system: deep blue (#0B3D91), emerald green accent, soft aqua gradient, white background, bold sans-serif typography, scroll-triggered fade-in animations throughout

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can browse a polished, fully responsive single-page agency website, learn about ImpactFlow's services, and submit a campaign inquiry via the contact form.
